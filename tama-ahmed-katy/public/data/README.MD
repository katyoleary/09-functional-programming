# Project Name

**Author**: Tama, Katy and Ahmed.
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
As a user, I want an admin page so I can easily view the stats of my blog app. I want to get the statisticts of the word count of each authors blog.

## Getting Started
As a user, I must wrap our article.js and and articleView.js in a IIFE so that the author statitics are immediatley invoked when the app runs. I want to set up a template for each row of the Author Stats section.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->we are using articleView.js, article.js, admin.html, index.html, MDN, handlebars, and jQuery.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.

## Credits and Collaborations
Thank you to all the TA's for help and Tama, Katy and Ahmed for sticking to it and maybe getting it to work.
